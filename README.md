The analysis is conducted in the trust_exp1_analysis.Rmd file, and requires the datafiles ullman_malle_2019.csv and trust_exp1_data.csv.

Experiment 2: Trust Across Agents 🐶🤖🧑
This study explores trust judgments across different agent types (humans, dogs, robots). The analysis is conducted in the trust_exp2_analysis.Rmd file, and requires the data file trust_exp2_data.csv
